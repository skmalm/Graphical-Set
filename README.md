# Graphical-Set
Stanford CS193P Developing Application for iOS Fall 2017-18 Assignment 3

This is an app version of the card game called Set. It is my complete project for Stanford CS193P assignment 3.
It builds on Assignment 2 by including multi-touch gestures, custom drawing, and dynamic card layout, among other features.

The only external tool I'm using is the Grid utility created by the instructor (see Grid.swift).
